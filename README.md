# Git-practice
As part of an exercise to become more familiar with github and HTML + CSS I decided to create a little resume. 
It has all the same information as a resume that I would hand out to someone at a job fair.
Very new to HTML and CSS so the design is very minimal but, after all, it is just a resume so it doesn't need to be particularly extravagant. A published version can be found at: https://carolina-brager.github.io/Git-practice/
